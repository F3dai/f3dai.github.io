The internet is much bigger than you may expect. You wont see the dark or deep web with normal search engines like Google. This article will be outlining what the so called "dark web" is, how it works, what you can find on it and how to access it.
 
### The Basics

The web, as we know, is comprised of 3 layers: 

- The surface layer
- The deep web
- The dark web

There is mass confusion about this, so this will quickly explain it.
 
The surface web is what can be accessed through search engines such as Google, yahoo and Bing. Websites like Wikipedia, YouTube and Facebook are all available on this platform.
 
The deep web is believed to contain 90% of the information available on the web as it not indexed with conventional search engines. The types of information include government resources, medical records, academic research and many more.
 
Now onto the dark web. This is a branch of the deep that is only accessible using specialized anonymous services such as the TOR browser, which allows the user to remain untraceable. It contains an estimated 7,500 TB’s of data and allows for people to do illegal activities.
 
Now we are aware of the layout of the web, let’s talk more into the browser which makes this possible.
 
### Tor Browser

The Tor browser is an open-source web browser that allows for anonymous connection into the dark web and protects the privacy on both client and server sides. It works by using something called a relay connection. So, when sending network traffic, it travels through random proxy servers before reaching the final destination. This protects your privacy through virtual tunnels and ultimately renders your IP address untraceable.
 
Websites on the tor browser are hosted on the .onion domain. This specialized domain which offers services only accessible via the tor network. A typical site would usually look like this:

<pre>http://123456789.com/abcdefg</pre>

This consists of the protocol used (http), the domain name (12345679.com) and the path it follows (abcdefg). On the contrary, onion sites are usually randomly generated, making them just a string of random characters. A typical site looks like this:

<pre>d72jLElmdbc9a0xlCK10.onion</pre> 

What makes the .onion so secure is that it uses multiple layers of encryption to hide all information about the packet. A type of network packet contains the data and information, but it also includes the incriminating metadata, which consists of the source and destination of the packet. As previously mentioned, these are sent across a relay of proxy servers, further improving the security.
 
All in all, It’s a pretty cool browser. You can find the link to download here just below:

### What can you find

There are multiple marketplaces on the dark web, which allows users to purchase a plethora of illegal goods and services. You can buy a wide variety of drugs, counterfeit money, stolen subscription credentials, stolen cards, illicit software, weapons, a diverse selection of services and many more.
 
However, it’s not all bad! Remember, the network first started as a service to remain anonymous, so there are legitimate websites on it. For example, BBC, The New York Times and even the CIA themselves have their own .onion sites.

### How to access it?

Now the best bit that everyone has been waiting for, how to access the dark web!

1)  On a standard search engine, look for Tor Browser, and follow the instructions on the website on how to install it (link provided above)
 
2)  Open the browser, and search for the .onion sites you want. A popular site which contains lots of information about the various onion sites is dark.fail

3)  Once on the desired website, continue with your intentions.
 
For added security, you can download a VPN to mask your web traffic. To even further protect your identity, you can host the browser on a disposable virtual machine, more specifically, Tails! Stay tuned for our tutorial on how to set up a tails virtual machine.
