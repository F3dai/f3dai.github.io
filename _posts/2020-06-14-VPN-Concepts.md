Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are commonly used to **remotely and securely** connect to a network. A private network is created over the internet in order to connect hosts. Security is accomplished by creating a **cryptographic tunnel**.

Remote users can securely access a network as if it was on the **local network**. Organisations may need remote employees accessing the network resources, creating a security concern.

A VPN emulates a direct network connection. In other words, the VPN provides both same level of access and same level of security as a direct connection.
