Keys - "Can you decrypt the message?" This is a Hackthebox challenge under the Crypto Challenges. You must be signed up to https://hackthebox.eu to access this box.

**URL:** [Crypto Challenges](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/challenges/Crypto)

**Difficulty:** Easy / Medium

We are given an archive with a .txt file called *keys.txt*.

There is some cypher text in the file:

<pre>hBU9lesroX_veFoHz-xUcaz4_ymH-D8p28IP_4rtjq0=
gAAAAABaDDCRPXCPdGDcBKFqEFz9zvnaiLUbWHqxXqScTTYWfZJcz-WhH7rf_fYHo67zGzJAdkrwATuMptY-nJmU-eYG3HKLO9WDLmO27sex1-R85CZEFCU=</pre>

I initially thought this was Base64, but there are some characters you would not expect in a Base64 value.

Anyway, converting from base64 gives us this:

<pre>..=.ë+¡{Þ..óÅG.Ï.¦.?)ÛÂ.â»c«</pre>

This just seems wrong. 

We have been given two different base64-like strings, maybe one is a key? I looked up some algorithms and clues and finally found this:

[Fernet (symmetric encryption)](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/)

*Fernet guarantees that a message encrypted using it cannot be manipulated or read without the key.*

Here is our script that imports the first string as a key, and the second as the token which we decrypt.

<pre>>>> from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
>>> key = "hBU9lesroX_veFoHz-xUcaz4_ymH-D8p28IP_4rtjq0="
>>> f = Fernet(key)
>>> token = "gAAAAABaDDCRPXCPdGDcBKFqEFz9zvnaiLUbWHqxXqScTTYWfZJcz-WhH7rf_fYHo67zGzJAdkrwATuMptY-nJmU-eYG3HKLO9WDLmO27sex1-R85CZEFCU="
>>> print(f.decrypt(token))
Flag : HTB{N0t_A_Fl1g!}</pre>
